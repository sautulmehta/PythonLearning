# In C#, we need to end the statement with semicolon, but anyhow we are going to indent our code and going to write a new statement on new Line. Do we really need it?? In Python, Not.

print('Hello World')

# And this will print Hello World in console. No class declaration needed for this :) In Visual Studio, we get this C# REPL option in interactive window.
